*This project studies the performance, abilities, and operation of free, open-source digital forensic tools on a portable device. The main objective of the project will be to create a wrapper that will combine the multiple tools available to perform different digital forensic tasks allowing for quick and easy use for these tools. Furthermore, looking at the capabilities of these portable devices to understand how they can be used to advance companies and users in their digital investigations. Performance testing will also be conducted to evaluate the overall viability of these portable devices with use of an ARM single board computer.*
